# ⚡ Monad Nad.fun Trading Suite

Ultra-fast automation for the Monad ecosystem covering sniping, volume engineering, multi-wallet orchestration, copy trading, and auxiliary token operations.

## 🌐 Overview
- Native to Monad’s low-latency EVM, optimized for sub-second execution across hot wallets.
- Modular stack: Bundler, Sniper, Volume Bot, Copy Trading Bot, and Token Tools.
- Built for professional operators who need deterministic controls, telemetry, and rapid rollouts.

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Rust** — core execution engines, mempool listeners, anti-MEV logic.
- **TypeScript** — orchestration layers, UI dashboards, Telegram/Discord bridges.
- **Python** — analytics modules, wallet intelligence workflows, batch utilities.

## 🛡️ Operational Safeguards
- Explicit limits across caps, retries, and slippage on every strategy.
- Hot-wallet focus; cold storage keys remain offline at all times.
- Deployments assume compliance with local regulations and exchange or RPC terms.

## 🚀 Capabilities
